# Synthea Data Warehouse Project

This project implements a complete data warehouse solution using synthetic healthcare data generated by Synthea. It includes database modeling, creation of datamarts, view-based data extraction, and interactive visualizations built in Tableau.

## Project Structure

- `Synthea_DB.sql`: SQL script for creating the MySQL database schema and tables
- `SQL_Views.sql`: SQL script for creating views that serve as sources for the data marts
- `synthea_dashboard.twbx`: Tableau workbook file containing the dashboards and visualizations
- `project_report.pdf`: Comprehensive report detailing the entire process, including ER diagrams, star schemas, screenshots, and query explanations

## Tools Used

- MySQL Server
- MySQL Workbench
- Python
- Tableau
- Git and GitHub

## Summary

The project follows a complete data warehousing pipeline, including:

1. Conceptual modeling using an ER diagram
2. Physical implementation of the schema and relationships in MySQL
3. Identification of 11 key analytical queries covering different aspects of the data
4. Design and modeling of 6 datamarts using attribute trees, fact schemas, and star schemas
5. Implementation of SQL views for each datamart
6. Visualization and dashboard creation in Tableau based on the SQL views

## Data Marts

Each datamart is designed to answer specific decision-support queries and includes a dedicated star schema. Dimensions and facts were carefully selected based on query requirements.

## Visualizations

The Tableau dashboards provide insights into:
- Patient demographics
- Diagnoses and procedures
- Encounters and admissions
- Medication prescriptions
- Observations and vital signs

## Report

The included PDF report documents each phase of the project, including schema diagrams, data marts, SQL logic, and screenshots of the Tableau dashboards.
